1. Position: Static
What is the default position value for HTML elements?
Write CSS to create a header that stays in its normal flow (static position) without affecting other elements.

2. Position: Relative
How does the position property change when set to "relative"?
Create a div that moves 20px to the right and 10px down using position: relative.

3. Position: Absolute
What happens when an element is positioned as "absolute"? How does it affect the layout?
Position a div absolutely within a parent container that has a position set to "relative." Align it to the bottom right.

4. Position: Fixed
Explain how a "fixed" positioned element behaves on the page during scrolling.
Create a fixed sidebar on the left of the page that stays in place while the rest of the content scrolls.

5. Position: Sticky
What is the difference between "sticky" and "fixed" positioning?
Design a sticky navigation bar that becomes fixed at the top of the page when the user scrolls down past it.

6. Combination of Positions
How do relative, absolute, and fixed positions interact with each other in a nested layout? Explain with an example.
Create a layout with a header (relative), content section (absolute), and footer (fixed). Ensure each element maintains its intended position.

7. Understanding z-index with Positioning
How does the z-index property work with positioned elements?
Create two overlapping boxes where one is positioned absolutely, and the other is fixed. Use z-index to control which box appears on top.

8. Positioning within Different Containers
How does setting different position values within nested containers affect element layout? Explain with an example.
Build a container with multiple child elements using a mix of relative and 
absolute positioning.

9. Responsive Design and Positioning
How can you use position properties to create responsive layouts?
Design a layout where a sidebar appears fixed on large screens but becomes a relative element on smaller screens.
