1.  Modify the layout so that all the boxes are arranged in a column instead of a row. Use flexbox properties to achieve this.

Instructions:

Use the flex-direction property to change the direction of the flex items.
Ensure that all boxes are stacked vertically inside the container.
Expected Outcome: The boxes should be arranged one below the other in a single column.

2. Center all the boxes horizontally and vertically within the container.

Instructions:

Use appropriate flexbox properties to center the flex items.
Adjust both the horizontal and vertical alignment of the boxes within the container.
Expected Outcome: All boxes should be centered inside the container both horizontally and vertically.


3. Change the order of the boxes such that the third box (Box3) appears first, and the second box (Box2) appears last.

Instructions:

Use the order property to rearrange the boxes.
Only adjust the order property for specific boxes as required.
Expected Outcome: Box3 should be the first box, and Box2 should be the last box in the sequence.

4. Allow the third box (Box3) to grow and fill up more space than the other boxes.

Instructions:

Use the flex-grow property to make the third box grow relative to the other boxes.
Ensure that Box3 occupies the maximum space available without affecting the overall layout.
Expected Outcome: Box3 should be noticeably larger than the other boxes within the container.

5.  Modify the container so that if the boxes exceed the width of the container, they wrap into the next line.

Instructions:

Use the flex-wrap property to enable wrapping.
Adjust the layout so that when the width of the container is exceeded, the boxes start on a new line.
Expected Outcome: When the boxes can't fit in one line, they should wrap onto the next line within the container.

6. Basic Alignment Using justify-content
Problem: Align all the boxes to the right side of the container using the justify-content property.

Instructions:

Use the justify-content property to align the boxes.
Ensure the boxes are positioned at the end of the container.
Expected Outcome: All boxes should be aligned to the right side of the container.

7. Modify the container so that the boxes are evenly distributed with the first and last items aligned with the container edges.

Instructions:

Use the justify-content property with the appropriate value to achieve this layout.
Ensure there are equal gaps between the boxes, but no gap on the outer edges.
Expected Outcome: Boxes should have equal spaces between them, with the first and last boxes touching the edges of the container.

8. Center all the boxes horizontally within the container using the justify-content property.

Instructions:

Use the justify-content property to center the boxes.
Ensure the boxes are in the middle of the container with equal space on either side.
Expected Outcome: All boxes should be centered within the container.

9.  Adjust the container so that there is equal spacing around each box within the container.

Instructions:

Use the justify-content property with the space-around value.
Make sure there are equal spaces on all sides of each box within the container.
Expected Outcome: Each box should have equal spacing on its left and right sides, including the space between the first and last boxes and the container's edges.

10. Modify the container to distribute the boxes with equal spacing between them and the container edges.

Instructions:

Use the justify-content property with the space-evenly value.
Ensure there is equal space between each box and also between the boxes and the container's edges.
Expected Outcome: All boxes should have perfectly equal spacing between each other and the container edges.

11.  Align all the boxes to the top of the container using the justify-content property.

Instructions:

Use the justify-content property to position the boxes at the start of the container.
Make sure all the boxes are aligned at the top without any space above them.
Expected Outcome: All boxes should be stacked at the top of the container.

12. Align all the boxes to the bottom of the container using the justify-content property.

Instructions:

Use the justify-content property to position the boxes at the end of the container.
Ensure all the boxes are aligned at the bottom without any space below them.
Expected Outcome: All boxes should be aligned at the bottom of the container.

13. Center all the boxes vertically within the container using the justify-content property.

Instructions:

Use the justify-content property with the center value.
Ensure that the boxes are positioned in the middle of the container with equal space above and below.
Expected Outcome: All boxes should be centered vertically within the container.

14. Modify the container so that the boxes have equal space around them vertically.

Instructions:

Use the justify-content property with the space-around value.
Ensure there is equal spacing around each box, including between the first and last boxes and the container edges.
Expected Outcome: Each box should have equal space on its top and bottom sides, including spaces between the container’s edges and the boxes.

15. Adjust the container to ensure that the boxes are distributed evenly with equal space between them and the container edges.

Instructions:

Use the justify-content property with the space-evenly value.
Make sure all boxes are evenly spaced with equal distances between each box and the edges of the container.
Expected Outcome: All boxes should have equal spacing between each other and equal spacing from the top and bottom edges of the container.

16. Adjust the container so that the rows of boxes are centered vertically within the container.

Instructions:

Use the align-content property to center the rows of boxes.
Ensure the rows are centered vertically in the container, with equal space above and below them.
Expected Outcome: The rows of boxes should be centered vertically within the container.

17. Align each box to the top of the container using the align-items property.

Instructions:

Use the align-items property with the flex-start value.
Ensure that all boxes are aligned to the top of the container regardless of their individual heights.
Expected Outcome: All boxes should be aligned to the top of the container.

18. Modify the container so that the rows of boxes are evenly distributed with the first row aligned at the top and the last row at the bottom.

Instructions:

Use the align-content property with the space-between value.
Ensure there is equal space between each row of boxes, with no space at the top and bottom of the container.
Expected Outcome: Rows should be evenly distributed with equal gaps between them, touching the top and bottom edges of the container.

19. Adjust the container so that the rows of boxes have equal space around them.

Instructions:

Use the align-content property with the space-around value.
Make sure each row has equal spacing above and below it, including spaces between the container’s edges and the rows.
Expected Outcome: Each row of boxes should have equal spacing on top and bottom, including the spaces at the edges of the container.

20. Make all the boxes stretch to fill the available height in their row, keeping the width fixed.

Instructions:

Use the align-items property with the stretch value.
Ensure that the boxes expand to fill the full height of their row, while their width remains unchanged.
Expected Outcome: All boxes should stretch to fill the height of their row, regardless of their individual content or original height setting.
